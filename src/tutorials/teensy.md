# DSP on the Teensy With Faust

## Introduction

The [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy) is a development board series based on a microcontroller and distributed by [PJRC](https://www.pjrc.com). The Teensy 3.(2+) boards are based on an ARM Cortex-M4 providing plenty of computational power for real-time audio signal processing applications. In particular, the Cortex-M4 used on the [Teensy 3.6](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/techspecs.html) (MK66FX1M0VMD18) hosts a Floating Point Unit (FPU) and has a clock of 180MHz (overclockable to 240MHz). PJRC recently released the [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html), which is based on a Cortex-M7 (FPU) with a clock of 600MHz and much more memory than the 3.6. When combined with their respective [audio shields](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3_audio.html) (also distributed by PJRC), the Teensy 3.6/4.0 can be used to synthesize and process sound with advanced algorithms. [This paper](https://zenodo.org/record/3249282#.XRxurXVfhjE) provides a survey on the performance of such systems when used with Faust-generated DSP objects.

Using this type of chip for embedded real-time audio DSP presents a wide range of advantages:

* low power consumption (i.e., can be easily powered by a battery),
* bare-metal: the lack of operating system allows for the use of very low block sizes (i.e., as low as 8 samples on the Teensy) and therefore extremely low latency,
* very short boot time (<1s),
* etc.

The Teensy/[Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html) comes with an [Audio Library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html) that can be used to synthesize sound directly on the Teensy. It uses a patching paradigm where DSP objects can be connected together using virtual patch chords. An [online tool](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gui/index.html) provides a user interface to this system and allows for the implementation of sound processing algorithms in a "Max/MSP way." Various elements can be used as the input and the output of the system (e.g., built-in Teensy DAC/ADC, audio shield, etc.). More information and tutorials can be found on the [Audio Library webpage](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html).

The current DSP objects of the Teensy Audio Library can be used to implement simple algorithms but their scope is relatively limited (i.e., basic oscillators, filters, etc.). [faust2teensy](../manual/tools.md#faust2teensy) can be used to implement new objects for the Teensy Audio Library using Faust. Since Faust is currently not able to produce fixed-point DSP C++ code, generated objects use floating-point arithmetic internally. The main consequence is that this system will only work efficiently if it's used on a Teensy board hosting an FPU. Hence, we strongly recommend using the Teensy 3.6/4.0 for this (things will work on the 3.2, but computational power will be extremely limited). 

This tutorial walks you through the steps of synthesizing sound with Faust on the Teensy.

## Band-Limited Sawtooth Oscillator on the Teensy

> The source code of the section can be downloaded [here](teensy/misc/teensy.zip)

The Teensy Audio Library doesn't come with any band-limited sawtooth wave oscillator (which is crucial to the implementation of good-quality virtual analog synthesizers). The Faust libraries come with a wide range of band-limited oscillators that can be easily ported to the Teensy. 

The following program (`FaustSawtooth.dsp`) implements a sawtooth wave oscillator with controllable gain and frequency:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
freq = nentry("freq",440,20,20000,0.01) : si.smoo;
gain = nentry("gain",1,0,1,0.01) : si.smoo;
process = os.sawtooth(freq)*gain;
```
<!-- /faust-run -->

`si.smoo` is used to interpolate the values of the `freq` and `gain` parameters to prevent clicks and abrupt changes. 

This Faust program can be turned into an object for the Teensy Audio Library simply by running the following command in a terminal:

```
faust2teensy -lib FaustSawtooth.dsp
```

which will generate a zip file containing a `.cpp` and a `.h` file in return. Alternatively, the Faust online compilation service can be used through the [Faust Web IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr) to carry out this task (Export(Truck)/source/teensy). The generated package should contain a file called `FaustSawtooth.cpp` and `FaustSawtooth.h`. 

Create a new project in the Arduino/Teensyduino software (e.g., call it `faustSawtooth`) and place `FaustSawtooth.cpp` and `FaustSawtooth.h` in the same folder (whose name should probably be `/faustSawtooth`) as `faustSawtooth.ino`.

Replace the content of the Arduino program with the following:

```
#include <Audio.h>
#include "FaustSawtooth.h"

FaustSawtooth faustSawtooth;
AudioOutputI2S out;
AudioControlSGTL5000 audioShield;
AudioConnection patchCord0(faustSawtooth,0,out,0);
AudioConnection patchCord1(faustSawtooth,0,out,1);

void setup() {
  AudioMemory(2);
  audioShield.enable();
  audioShield.volume(0.1);
}

void loop() {
  faustSawtooth.setParamValue("freq",random(50,1000));
  delay(50);
}
``` 

First, the header file (`.h`) of the object generated with `faust2teensy` is included. An instance of `FaustSawtooth` is then created. Since the Teensy (3.6/4.0) that we're using for this tutorial is equipped with a Teensy Audio Shield, we also create an instance of `AudioOutputI2S` and `AudioControlSGTL5000`. We then connect the Faust object to the two outputs of the audio shield using `AudioConnection`s. Note that if the Faust object had a stereo output (i.e., `process = os.sawtooth(freq)*gain <: _,_`), the following should have been written instead:

```
AudioConnection patchCord0(faustSawtooth,0,out,0);
AudioConnection patchCord1(faustSawtooth,1,out,1);
``` 

The number of inputs and outputs of objects generated with `faust2teensy` corresponds to the number of inputs and outputs of the Faust program.

Two audio blocks of memory are allocated in `setup()`. Note that if the Faust object had audio inputs, this number should probably be greater (i.e., typically six for stereo in and stereo out).

`audioShield.enable()` activates the audio shield and `audioShield.volume(0.1)` sets the gain of the headphone output (this step is optional).

The value of the `freq` and `gain` parameters can be set using the `setParamValue` method. Note that for larger Faust objects, parameter paths might be used instead. Here, the value of `freq` is randomly generated every 50ms.

After making these changes, you should be able to compile and upload your sketch to the Teensy 4.0.

### Special Note About the Teensy 3.6

Before this program can be compiled and uploaded to the Teensy 3.6, some modifications need to be made to the configuration file used by the Teensyduino toolchain (`boards.txt`). You should be able to find it in `hardware/teensy/avr` in the source of the Arduino software (its location will vary depending on the platform you're using). The most important change is to use `g++` instead of `gcc` for linking, so: 

```
teensy36.build.command.linker=arm-none-eabi-gcc
``` 

should become: 

```
teensy36.build.command.linker=arm-none-eabi-g++
```

in `boards.txt`. Beware that on older versions of Teensyduino, these changes should be made directly to `platform.txt`.

After making these changes, you should be able to compile and upload your sketch to the Teensy 3.6.

## Audio Effect

> The source code of the section can be downloaded [here](teensy/misc/teensyEffect.zip)

The same procedure described in the previous section can be followed to generate audio effects for the Teensy Audio Library. [`dm.zita_light`](https://faust.grame.fr/doc/libraries/index.html#dm.zita_light) implements a high-quality stereo feedback delay network reverb. It hosts its own user interface elements/parameters to control its dry/wet mix (`Dry/Wet Mix`) and its level in dB (`Level`).

A simple Faust program (`FaustZita.dsp`) calling this effect could look like that:

<!-- faust-run -->
```
import("stdfaust.lib");
process = dm.zita_light;
```
<!-- /faust-run --> 

The corresponding Teensy Audio Library object can be generated by running:

```
faust2teensy -lib FaustZita.dsp
```

and finally called in a Teensy program: 

```
#include <Audio.h>
#include "FaustZita.h"

FaustZita faustZita;
AudioInputI2S in;
AudioOutputI2S out;
AudioControlSGTL5000 audioShield;
AudioConnection patchCord0(in,0,faustZita,0);
AudioConnection patchCord1(in,1,faustZita,1);
AudioConnection patchCord2(faustZita,0,out,0);
AudioConnection patchCord3(faustZita,1,out,1);

void setup() {
  AudioMemory(6);
  audioShield.enable();
  faustZita.setParamValue("level",0);
}

void loop() {
  float dw = analogRead(A0)/512 - 1;
  faustZita.setParamValue("dryWet",dw);
  delay(10);
}
```

Note that in this example, a potentiometer connected to the Analog Input 0 of the Teensy is used to control the dry/wet mix of the reverb.

## Additional Configuration for Low Audio Latency

Thanks to its bare-metal architecture, the Teensy allows for extremely low audio latency which would be more or less impossible to achieve if an operating system was used. Audio latency is mostly determined by the block size of the system. The default block size of the Teensy Audio Library is 128 samples but it can be cranked down to 8 samples (only if Faust DSP objects are used exclusively) without impacting performances too much (see the [corresponding SMC paper](https://zenodo.org/record/3249282#.XRxurXVfhjE)). Block size is set by a C++ macro (`AUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES`) that can be overridden before compilation by passing it as an argument to the C++ compiler by substituting the following line in `boards.txt` (see previous section):

```
teensy36.build.flags.defs=-D__MK66FX1M0__ -DTEENSYDUINO=146
```

with:

```
teensy36.build.flags.defs=-D__MK66FX1M0__ -DTEENSYDUINO=146 -DAUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES=8
```

on the Teensy 3.6, and:

```
teensy40.build.flags.defs=-D__MK66FX1M0__ -DTEENSYDUINO=146
```

with:

```
teensy40.build.flags.defs=-D__MK66FX1M0__ -DTEENSYDUINO=146 -DAUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES=8
```

on the Teensy 4.0.

Similarly, the sampling rate (44100KHz by default) can be set using the `AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE_EXACT` macro. Note that computing the "exact" sampling rate compatible with the clock of your Teensy might be a bit tricky. For example, `AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE_EXACT` is 44117.64706 by default and not 44100, etc.

### Warning!!!

In the latest version of the Teensy Audio Library, a "weird" correction to the code of the built-in freeverb function has been made an will prevent you from using a block size of 8 samples. Here's a fix to this problem that should be made in the installed version of `effect_freeverb.cpp`:

```
0, 0, 0, {
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
#if AUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES > 8
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
#endif
#if AUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES > 16
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
#endif
```

## Notes About Computational Power and Memory Footprint

While the Teensy 3.6 is relatively powerful and can be used to run complex DSP algorithm (up to 90 Faust sine waves in parallel), it doesn't have a lot of RAM. For that reason, algorithms with a large memory footprint (e.g., anything using delay a lot such a reverbs, wave table oscillators, etc.) might have to be adapted to be run on the Teensy. For example, the default Faust sine wave oscillator uses a table of 65536 samples which is to big to be loaded in the Teensy RAM. Hence, its definition should be adapted, e.g.:

```
osc(freq) = rdtable(tablesize, os.sinwaveform(tablesize), int(os.phasor(tablesize,freq)))
with{
	tablesize = 1 << 15; // instead of 1 << 16
};
``` 

Similarly, the maximum size of the delay lines of some reverb algorithms might be too big and should be adjusted. Using  the `-dlt` option can help, see the [Managing DSP Memory Size](../manual/optimizing.md#managing-dsp-memory-size) section.
