#### [Generate WAMs with FaustIDE](http://www.webaudiomodules.com/docs/usage/generate-with-faustide/)
[Web Audio Modules](http://www.webaudiomodules.com) (WAM) ias a standard for Web Audio plugins and DAWs. The 2.0 version of Web Audio Modules has been released in 2021 as a group effort by a large set of people and since then, multiple plugins and hosts have been published, mostly as open source and free software.

The FAUST IDE is a very popular tool for [generating WAMs from existing FAUST code](http://www.webaudiomodules.com/docs/usage/generate-with-faustide) (and there are hundreds of source code example available for audio effects, instruments, etc.). You can [generate WAMs directly](http://www.webaudiomodules.com/docs/usage/generate-with-faust) from the command line using the [faust2wam script](https://github.com/Fr0stbyteR/faust2wam).

#### [Mozzi Revisited](https://www.pschatzmann.ch/home/2024/03/15/mozzi-revisited/)

#### [Creating VSTs and more using FAUST](https://musichackspace.org/product/creating-vsts-and-more-using-faust/)

FAUST is a programming language that enables us to quickly create cross-platform DSP code. We can easily create VST plugins, Max-Externals and more. Its high-quality built-in library of effects and tools enables us to quickly draft high quality audio processing devices. The workshop aims at getting new users started, conveying what FAUST is good for and how to use it effectively to produce high quality results quickly.

### Code Generators
 
#### [faust2pdex](https://github.com/jujudusud/BPD/tree/master/tools/faust2pdex)
 
 Generator of Faust wrappers for Pure Data. This software wraps the C++ code generated by Faust into a native external for Pure Data. You obtain a piece of source code that you can use with pd-lib-builder to produce a native binary with the help of make. No knowledge of C++ programming is required.

#### [Faust.quark](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/faust.quark)

This SuperCollider package makes it possible to create SuperCollider packages (Quarks) containing plugins written in Faust code. With this, you can distribute plugins written in Faust and make it easy for others to install, compile or uninstall them. It also contains some simple interfaces for the `faust` and `faust2sc.py` commands used behind the scenes.

#### [ode2dsp](https://git.sr.ht/~kdsch/ode2dsp)

[ode2dsp](https://git.sr.ht/~kdsch/ode2dsp) is a Python library for generating ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers in digital signal processing (DSP) languages. It automates the tedious and error-prone symbolic calculations involved in creating a DSP model of an ODE.

Features:

- Support linear and nonlinear systems of ODEs
- Support trapezoidal and backward Euler discrete-time integral approximations
- Approximate solutions of implicit equations using Newton's method
- Render finite difference equations (FDEs) to Faust code
- Calculate stability of ODEs and FDEs at an operating point

#### [circle-faust](https://github.com/marchingband/circle-faust)

This repo demonstrates pwm audio output with an added DAC for pi-zero-2 using circle SDK.
